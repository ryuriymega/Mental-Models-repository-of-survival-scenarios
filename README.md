Anything can happen at any moment in your life, and better to be prepared for it...

Organize Content:

Use folders to categorize different types of scenarios (e.g., natural disasters, wilderness survival, urban survival).
Within each folder, create Markdown files (.md) for individual scenarios or types of mental models.

Create Template for Scenarios:

Develop a standard template for each scenario to ensure consistency. You might include fields like:
Scenario Description
Key Threats
Immediate Actions
Resources Needed
Decision-Making Process
Possible Outcomes

Populate Scenarios:

Research and write detailed descriptions for a variety of survival scenarios.
Provide actionable insights and mental models for each one.

Include Visual Aids:

Use diagrams, flowcharts, or mind maps to illustrate decision-making processes and survival strategies. These can be included in your Markdown files or as separate images.
